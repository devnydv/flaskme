It is enough to guess the story that the movie is trying to convey. On the other hand, the audience was waiting for such a movie from Ajay Devgn after Drishyam. Shaitan is a remake, but very few people are aware of the real movie, the 2023 Gujarati horror film Vash, so the Hindi audience may like the movie.",

The positive part of this movie was the action scenes, which were quite good and the only positive side of the movie. Overall, the movie can be regarded as an average one.",
